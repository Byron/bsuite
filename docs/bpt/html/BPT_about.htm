  <strong>Byron's Poly Tools</strong> were created to assist me in modeling, and to make it more
    efficient. But I
  didn't want to create just a Plug-In Version of MJ PolyTools I wanted to go
  further, getting rid of
  the limitations imposed by the scripts, and adding new features that I have
waited for a long time.</p>




<p>So I took all my MEL knowledge, threw it away (temporarily :) ), and started
  to learn Maya API.
  It was quite hard at the beginning (as everything is), but after a while, I
  got used to it :). One
  month was my personal deadline for learning Maya API and writing the Plug but
  ... after two
  months of development, the basic features were implemented, and working quite
  well :).</p>
<p>But then, I got new ideas, and started adding a working chamfer and solid
  chamfer, and soft
  selections, and a Soft Transformation Tool, and last but not least a smart
  move component
  ability. So, all in all, it took me 4 months of full-time work to learn Maya
  API and to write and
  debug the plugin. It definitely was worth it :). </p>
<p>This is the Version you have now, introducing ten tools:</p>

<table>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Smart Split <br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Solid Chamfer <br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Chamfer<br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Smart Edge Loop</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Smart Edge Ring</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Boundary</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Grow</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Shrink</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Smart Move Component</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; <i>Soft Transformation Tool</i><br>
</table>



<p>Last but not least, I really suggest you to <b>read through the whole documentation</b> carefully.
  This will be necessary to learn about the <i>"smart" features</i> as well as
  about the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><a href="BPT_Limitations.htm" target="main"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>limitations</b></font></a><br>
